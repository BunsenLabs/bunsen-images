	These images were made for BunsenLabs	April 2015
	
	If you are using nitrogen to set the desktop background, then "zoomed-fill"
	is usually the best setting if your screen resolution is different from
	the supplied image sizes
	
	This is "mode=5" in .config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg
	
	
	The same thing can be achieved using feh:
	
		feh --bg-fill image.png
