# bunsen-images and bunsen-images-extra
Artwork for logos, icons, avatars, splashes, backgrounds

bunsen-images
-------------
Desktop backgrounds will be installed in
/usr/share/images/bunsen/wallpapers/default

A grub background will be installed as
/usr/share/images/bunsen/grub/default.png

And the default login background as
/usr/share/images/bunsen/login/default.png

A Debian alternative for desktop-grub will be set up
in the standard location /usr/share/images/desktop-base/desktop-grub.png.

Notes about Wallpaper
---------------------

These images were made for BunsenLabs by damo, using GIMP-2.9, and others.

If you are using nitrogen to set the desktop background, then "zoomed-fill"
is usually the best setting if your screen resolution is different from
the supplied image sizes

This is "mode=5" in .config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg

The same thing can be achieved using feh:

	feh --bg-fill image.png
