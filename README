Notes about Wallpaper
---------------------

These images were made for BunsenLabs	April 2015
	
If you are using nitrogen to set the desktop background, then "zoomed-fill"
is usually the best setting if your screen resolution is different from
the supplied image sizes
	
This is "mode=5" in .config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg

The same thing can be achieved using feh:
	
	feh --bg-fill image.png
