/usr/share/images/bunsen/login/default.png

bunsen-images-extra
-------------------
Backgrounds will be installed as grub, login and wallpapers
and other images as icon-avatar and asciiart
under /usr/share/images/bunsen

Debian alternatives will be set up for desktop-grub
(in the standard location /usr/share/images/desktop-base/desktop-grub.png)
and for bl-login-background in /usr/share/images/bunsen/login/bl-login-background


Notes about Wallpaper
---------------------

These images were made for BunsenLabs by damo, using GIMP-2.9

If you are using nitrogen to set the desktop background, then "zoomed-fill"
is usually the best setting if your screen resolution is different from
the supplied image sizes

This is "mode=5" in .config/nitrogen/bg-saved.cfg

The same thing can be achieved using feh:

	feh --bg-fill image.png
